            ---------------

--- General things ---
This repository contains implementations of several data structures,
like linked lists, trees (binary search trees, AVL trees, ...) and
also basic graphs.


--- Compiling ---
You can either use the listed structures by including the modules 
in your programs, or you can test them with. For this, every 
implementation has a  test/  directory that includes a main method
which does some testing and output.
If you want to test like this, compile them just as usual for the
individual language:
( Replace the things in [ ] with the appropiate name ):

* C      ->  $>  gcc -c main.c
             $>  gcc -o [EXECUTABLE_NAME] main.o

* C++    ->  $>  g++ -c main.cpp
             $>  g++ -o [EXECUTABLE_NAME] main.o

* Java   ->  $>  javac main.java
             $>  java main
