            ---------------

--- General things ---
This repository contains implementations of several data structures,
like linked lists, trees (binary search trees, AVL trees, ...) and
also basic graphs.


--- MIPS Assembly ---
In order to execute the files wrote in MIPS Assembly code, I recommend the 
MARS emulator. There are some other emulators available, the code should work
on every of these, but the most handsome for a User is the MARS emulator.
The version I use is 4.4, the file is therefore named "Mars4_4.jar".

You can start it (of course when you have downloaded it) with

$> java -jar Mars4_4.jar

Then simple click "Open", load the file and then type "F3". This will assemble
the typed-in code. After that there is a "Run"-button in the symbol bar, that
execute the code with the speed determined by the bar at its right.
