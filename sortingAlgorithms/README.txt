                --- Sorting algorithms ---
This folder contains implementations of some well-known  sorting algorithms:
    
    #   Selection Sort
    #   Insertion Sort
    #   Bubble    Sort
    #   Quick     Sort
    #   Merge     Sort

There is also a testing module for each implementation of the individual
sorting algorithm. If you want to test it, either just use the test module
stored here or create your own and test it like you like.
